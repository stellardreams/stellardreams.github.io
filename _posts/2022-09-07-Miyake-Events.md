[Solar Flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) and [CME (Coronal Mass Ejections)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) are something that Rusith and I looked at briefly last year. As of September, 2021 Rusith has not been a part of the team. 

Since the initial time we looked into this phenomenon, I still have difficulty telling one event from another. So here is [an article](https://phys.org/news/2014-09-difference-cmes-solar-flares.html) that I Googled. 

More recently, I came across the following article via the Scientific American magazine. Here is the [link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-superflares-rocked-earth-less-than-10-000-years-ago-and-could-strike-again/). It's about 'Superflares' and in Cosmological terms, the 'Superflare' event, also known as a ['Miyake'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774%E2%80%93775_carbon-14_spike) event, happened recently. As early as 10,000 years ago. 

I am still drafting this post. As of 18:07 Eastern.
