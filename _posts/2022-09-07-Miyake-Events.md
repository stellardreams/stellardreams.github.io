[Solar Flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) and [CME - Coronal Mass Ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) are topics that we briefly looked at last year. As an aside, as of September last year I have been running with the two projects in an individual capacity.

Coming back to the topic, I still have difficulty telling one event from another. So here is [an article](https://phys.org/news/2014-09-difference-cmes-solar-flares.html) that I Googled. 

Note: I must state that this post is being made in good faith. At the same time, I do not have a background in [Heliophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliophysics) and associated areas. And so and as always, I am very open to criticism.

* Initially, my primary concern was that there are safeguards in place for critical facilities. However, contingent upon the scale of the event, the events could be not so good for civilization. There are a whole host of scenarios to consider and the outcome sitting on a spectrum. One between knocking civilization back by thousands of years to one of a controlled shutdown for the duration of the event.

Initially: 
* * I started thinking about shielding of some sorts. 
* * Then I started thinking about atomic and nuclear facilities. Based on the information highlighted in the following [link](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx#:~:text=Today%20there%20are%20about%20440,10%25%20of%20the%20world%27s%20electricity.), there are 400 such locations around the world. I am not sure what the impact on the nuclear facilities would be and contingent upon the scale/scope of the event. My main concern was that there is sheilding for such facilities. As well, there is some manual ability in order to shutdown the plants in a controlled manner. I wrote to an institution that is local to Canada and I was advised that there are procedures for Canadian Nuclear Power Plans (should a solar flare occur). I am not sure about Nuclear Power Plants outside of Canada. But I am thinking that the responsibility for ensuring that there is protection would be with [IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/)?




More recently, I came across the following article via the Scientific American magazine [link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-superflares-rocked-earth-less-than-10-000-years-ago-and-could-strike-again/). The article is about 'Superflares', also known as a ['Miyake'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774%E2%80%93775_carbon-14_spike) event. The article was published in September last year (2021), but I only stumbled across it about 2 months ago. 



In July this year, I stumbled across the following article via the Globe and Mail. [link](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-major-solar-storm-can-strike-earth-we-need-to-be-ready/)
