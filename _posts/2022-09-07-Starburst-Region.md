This is something I started looking into back in August. But not have been able to research further. And so, this post is not well-researched. My intention is to collaborate with others, so that we can refine this post.

According to Wikipedia

> A starburst is an astrophysical process that involves star formation occurring at a rate that is large compared to the rate that is typically observed. This starburst activity will consume the available interstellar gas supply over a timespan that is much shorter than the lifetime of the galaxy.

The set of questions I was thinking: 
* What is the actual shape of the Milky Way. With a keen focus on the mergers with other galaxies (dwarf and possibly others). 
* I think I read somewhere that there are pockets of dust clouds. I forget it it was Milky Way or another Galaxy that was observed. But the actual duration for which specific (Starburst) specific dust cloud emerge, the duraiton was cited to be between 6 to 9 million years. 
* I was asking around and I was told that there was something called [PHANGS](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=phangs&src=typed_query){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Which stands for **'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS'**
