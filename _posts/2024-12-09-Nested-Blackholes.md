Via [BBC Earth Science's - so called 5 hours of mind-blowing content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6_wBEdQFf4) via Youtube. It's a 5 hour video and I have gone through a fair chunk of it.

Around the [22:55 minute mark](https://youtu.be/u6_wBEdQFf4?t=1350), [Dr. Andrea M. Ghez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_M._Ghez) is explaining some of her work and her research related to [Sag A *](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_M._Ghez#Black_hole_at_the_Galactic_Center_(Sgr_A*))

What piqued my interest around the 22:55 minute. On the visualization being displayed, there appears to be stuff going around and whatever is happening in the very center of Dr. Andrea's screen. 
- There is some phenomenon that has layers of purple, blue, green and a core of red. It has an elliptical orbit that is showcased in yellow. See screenshot [here](https://github.com/stellardreams/stellardreams.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/12-13-2024-BBC-Five-Hours-Nested-Blackholes.PNG?raw=true) This screenshot has been taken directly from the source video that has been linked above.
- The orbit of this phenomenon reminds me of [Sedna's orbital eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedna_(dwarf_planet)#Orbit_and_rotation) around the solar system. Which I have blogged about here on Github [link](https://stellardreams.github.io/Sedna's-orbital-eccentricity/). And yes, these are different systems. As in, something going around, what looks to be like Sag A * (A Supermassive Blackhole) vs a rock like [Sedna](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~kenyon/pf/sedna/vid1.html) going around the Sun.
- The other thing I noticed was that the stuff/object circling the Blackhole was moving in it's orbit, what seemed to be like varying speeds. So I started thinking. That either a. There is more mass around the areas where the object slows down. Or b. There are other/nested blackholes situated in these regions. Which would not only explains the orbital eccentricity of the object in motion. But the varying speeds around particular points.

I make these observations without having looked at any data. Sans the one brief animation via the source above. Which I should link. I am not on the same machine. 

Some associated thoughts that I am now thinking:
- Pfalzer's (recalling name from memory) research may posit that the behavior of TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) can be explained, if we place a stellar body zipping by (previous post). 
- But could it be, that and in random order: a. This phenomenon of stars (maybe blackholes) zipping by is more frequent. Not sure about the frequency. Dr. Loeb  and Pfalzer would be good candidates to discuss. b. In addition to, a blckhole of a certain size may still exist in the outer solar system region. Unless, Pfalzer's research defines the behavior of TNO's convincingly and exclusively. c. I had some associated thoughts on the reported slowdown and reversal (direction) of the spin of the Earth's core. d. Reports that indicate that the core has been  leaking heavy iron for Billions of years.

Next and coming back,not sure, the degree to which. There is also criticism of this report of the core spin slowing down/reversing direction etc. I have only read a handful of articles on this topic. But if this is true, I was thinking that maybe this could be due to the gravitational pull of stuff zipping by and some phenomenon in the outer solar system that has a gravitational effect. If such phenomenon impact the flow of stuff inside of Earth, then that will change a lot of other things. I have another question, if such behaviors also explain the faster than normal movement of the magnetic North towards Siberia.

Now I am thinking if a very sensitive ['Foucalt's pendulum'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum) somewhere in space could help us come up with answers to queries like this. 

I am not sure if this would indeed be the way to get to answers to questions like these. As differet planetary bodies that exist, will be exerting their gravitational pull on this pendulum. 

Maybe, multiple iterations of such a hypothetical device can be situated across the solar system. 

For packet-sniffing, the ability to hone in on protocols has existed for quite some time. In theory and borrowing from this, tools would be developed that could help pick and choose the gravitional effects. Thus allowing us to help create a picture of what kind of gravitational effects are being exerted. 

Via such a construct, we should, in theory, be in a capacity to answer other primary/fundamental questions. Including the questions highlighted. Is there a small blackhole in the outer solar system and is it's gravitational pull interacting with Earth's core.

Shifting movements in and around the core. The degree to which and in timelines involving ranges of time normative to generations. Helping predict these movements in advance will save a lot of lives. And quality of lives also.
