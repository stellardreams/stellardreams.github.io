I was watching comtemt via BBC's Science Team via Youtube. It's a 5 hour video and I have gone through about 100 minutes of content. 

During the 100 minute mark of the segment, there is a female scientist speaking about Blackhole. I didnt get a chance to document the name of the researcher. 

I noticed that there was stuff that was documented to go around this Blackhole. But:
- It had a more oblong orbit. Kind of like Sedna's orbital eccentricity around the solar system. Which I have blogged about on here. And yes, these are different systems. Blackhole vs the Sun.
- The other thing I noticed was that the stuff/ojbect circling the Blackhole was moving in it's orbit, what seemed to be like varying speeds. So I started thinking. That either there is more mass around the areas where the object slows down. Or there are other/nested blackholes situated in these regions. Which would not only explain the orbital eccentricity of the object in motion. But the varying speeds around particular points.

I make these observations without having looked at any data. Sans the one brief animation via the source above. Which I should link. I am not on the same machine. 

Some associated thoughts that I am now thinking:
- Pfalzer's (recalling name from memory) research may posit that the behavior of TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) can be explained, if we place a stellar body zipping by (previous post). 
- But could it be, that and in random order: a. This phenomenon of stars (maybe blackholes) zipping by is more frequent. Not sure about the frequency. Dr. Loeb  and Pfalzer would be good candidates to discuss. b. In addition to, a blckhole of a certain size may still exist in the outer solar system region. Unless, Pfalzer's research defines the behavior of TNO's convincingly and exclusively. c. I had some associated thoughts on the reported slowdown and reversal (direction) of the spin of the Earth's core. Some reports suggests that the core is now leaking. Not sure, the degree to which. There is also criticism of this report of the core spin slowing down/reversing direction etc. I have only read a handful of articles on this topic. But if this is true, I was thinking that maybe this could be due to the gravitational pull of stuff zipping by and some phenomenon that has a gravitational effect. 

Now I am thinking if a very sensitive 'Foucalt's pendulum' somewhere in space could help us come up with answers to queries like this. 

I am not sure if this would indeed be the way to get to answers to questions like these. As differet planetary bodies that exist, will be exerted their gravitational pull on this pendulum. 

Maybe, multiple iterations of such a hypothetical device can be situated across the solar system. 

For packet-sniffing, the ability to hone in on protocols has existed for quite some time. In theory and borrowing from this, tools would be developed that could help pick and choose the gravitional effects. Thua allowing us to hwlp create a picture of what kind of gravitational effecta are being exerted. 

Via such a construct, we should, in theory, be in a capacity to answer other primary/fundamental questions. Including the questions highlighted. Is there a small blackhole in the outer solar system and is it's gravitational pull interacting with Earth's core
