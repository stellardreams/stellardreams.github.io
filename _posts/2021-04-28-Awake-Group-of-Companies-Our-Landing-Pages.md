Good day, 

How are you doing today?

We didn't have a presence on the web. Focusing on the utility, I personally did not want to pay $12 USD.

So I just just started creating a landing page using basic HTML and CSS. Here is the very first version for both of the developments. Feedback is super welcome and appreciated.
