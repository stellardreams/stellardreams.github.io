Good day, 

How are you doing today?

We didn't have a presence on the web. Focusing on the utility, I personally did not want to pay $12 USD.

So I just just started creating a landing page using basic HTML and CSS. 

Here (links below) is the very first version for both of the developments. Feedback is super welcome and appreciated.

| AUH           | http://auh.surge.sh/ | https://github.com/stellardreams/auh.surge.sh  |


The landing pages are hosted on **surge** and as you may have noticed. https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge
