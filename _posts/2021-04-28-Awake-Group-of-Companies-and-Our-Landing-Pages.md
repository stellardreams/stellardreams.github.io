Good day, 

How are you doing today?

We didn't have a presence on the web. Focusing on the utility, I personally did not want to pay $12 USD per month.

So I just started creating a landing page (or pages) using basic HTML and CSS. 

Here (links below) is the very first version for both of the developments. Feedback is super welcome and appreciated. 


|               | Website              | Github Repo   |
| ------------- | -------------        | ------------- |
| ASI           | [http://asi.surge.sh/](http://asi.surge.sh/) | [ASI Code Repo on Github](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh)  |
| AUH           | [http://auh.surge.sh/](http://auh.surge.sh/) | [AUH Code Repo on Github](https://github.com/stellardreams/auh.surge.sh)  |


The landing pages are hosted on **surge** and as you may have noticed. Check out the following page, if you'd like to get started using [surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge).
