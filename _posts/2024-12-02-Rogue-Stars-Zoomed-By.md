Yesterday, 

a. [A search leveraging the string - this is a google news search link - but always a good idea to check links before you click on them](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=32e73b67f33f8410&q=earth+com+trans+neptunian+object&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J7pRxUp2pI1mXV9fBsfh39Jw_Y7pXPv6W9UjIXzt09-Y-RVsUQytO3H9U9unQ4zjSmyc1am7RU9IOaZeZLN-vxqOLRVgtOkNIBInceOOInHD1Vy8A8dMZkK6qsEDDgBo37uamqwPID1ktpoxri6hURFY-RftoYl5J3cAxl4SOYvmGkrX6Q&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT34uux4mKAxXUv4kEHYvDKEIQ0pQJegQIFBAB&biw=1137&bih=567&dpr=2.25)  
b. lead me to the following article: [Rogue star zoomed by our Solar System and disrupted planetary orbits](https://www.earth.com/news/rogue-star-zoomed-by-our-solar-system-disrupted-planetary-orbits-stretched-edges/) 

The name of the astrophysicist mentioned and a link to their profile via Google scholar is as follows: 
- [Susanne Pfalzner of Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dplYCPwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&citft=3&sortby=pubdate)
- Susanne Pfalzner is associated with the [University of Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) I am assuming that this university works collaboratively with the Forschungszentrum Jülich institute (link is below).
- The names of two of Susanne Pfalzner's students are also mentioned. The names are: Amith Govind and Simon Portegies Zwart.

Susanne's research reminds me of: 
- The mention of some of Dr. Avi Loeb's research, along with his graduate students and team members. The little I know about research that may be associated from some of the articles that I have stumbled across. Here is a link to [Dr. Loeb's profile on Google Scholar.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CvQxOmwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&citft=3&email_for_op=adeelnkhan%40gmail.com&sortby=pubdate)
- Going back to Susanne Pfalzer's research, particularly via the Earth.com article highlighted above. Here, for me: 
  - And to provide some context. The very first time that I heard about TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) actually being called TNOs was via Professor Brian Cox. This must have been at-least 6 years ago and I cannot recall the source at this point. But I recall that it was via a video that I was watching. It's sad that the algorithms have gone all wonky on content based sites and discovery is not just broken, it feels like it has been weaponized. But that is a completely separate topic.
  - Coming back to this topic, during the past couple of years and I cannot say that I think about this and associated areas often. But specific to the research for TNOs and in random order, I would think that only a handful of researchers are looking at this and associated areas/phenomenon around the world. And that the majority of the researchers are either from the UK (United Kingdom) and now Germany (Forschungszentrum Jülich) via [Susanne Pfalzer](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/@@search?SearchableText=Susanne%20Pfalzner&active=relevance&allow_local=false&group_select=0&local=false)
  - It was intuition and I guess relaxation, that lead me to think associated thoughts. I am very interested in the make/composition of the reality around the MilkyWay and the much more expansive (and relative) cosmological (most likely quantum) realms. Specific to TNOs, here are some of the posts that I can think of. The direct source for these posts is directly via Github (unless states otherwise, as in links via Youtube and external links that I did not provision e.t.c)

    - A gravitational pull, that is 'not' normative to the typical and expectation gravitional pull of objects in and around the outer solar system region. Whereby the definition of outer solar system in this scenario would be in a confined space, but related to objects past the orbit of the planet Neptune. This is not a comprehensive timeline from my perspective, but I guess this is how one thing lead to another. 
      - 10-18-2019 (Oct 18, 2019): I was at a hackathon and there was an image of [Sag A * (Sagittarius A star, the Supermassive blackhole at the center of the Milkyway)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*) that came up via the APOD bot via the Slack app.
        - It will take me a while to search for the same/similar image via [APOD search](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search). But if memory serves me correctly, the image looked something like this. [image via nova.org](https://chview.nova.org/solcom/x-objects/sagdeg1.jpg). As well, some of the other images where I found this image, via the [following source](https://chview.nova.org/solcom/x-objects/sag-deg.htm)   
      -  10-29-2020 (Oct, 29. 2020): Much earlier and maybe around the year 2005 or in that range, is when I would have first heard about the mythical Planet 9. Not having an indepth knowledge of how real-estate is actually discovered in and around the solar system (as in, the methods leveraged) and realizing that a fair bit of territory needs to be covered. I didn't know how to think about why the so called/mythical Planet 9 was not discovered. Next and many years later, when the news item of a blackhole the size of a grapefruit came to my attention. This, then lead me to think about the kinds of behaviors that were being exhibited by bodies in the trans-Neptunian region(s). For the further evoluion of this theory, one of being a mythical planet that no one could locate, to a blackhole of a certain size. And so, on 10-29-2020, I made the following post on Github on this very blog. [Grape Fruit Sized Black Hole In The Outer Solar System](https://stellardreams.github.io/Grape-fruit-sized-Black-Hole-in-the-outer-solar-system/)
    - 11-02-2020 (Nov 2nd, 2020): On this date, I made the following blogpost about [Sedna's orbital eccentricity](https://stellardreams.github.io/Sedna's-orbital-eccentricity/). Which, just stands out as odd and makes you wonder why this rock is 'not' following the same path and does not have the same/similar kind of orbital eccentricity like it's neighbors in and around the inner-solar system.
    - 02-12-2021 (Feb 12, 2021): After having read a particular article via SciAm (Scientific American), I made the following blogpost about [Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov](https://stellardreams.github.io/Interstellar-Objects/)
    - 09-07-2022 (Sept 07, 2022): I am not sure how much, the following blogpost is on topic here. But in this blogpost, I was still pondering about the general shape/composition of the MilkyWay. [Starbust Region](https://stellardreams.github.io/Starburst-Region/)
