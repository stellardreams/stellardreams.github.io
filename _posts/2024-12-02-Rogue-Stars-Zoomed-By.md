Yesterday, 

a. [Search leveraging the string - this is a google news search link - but always a good idea to check links before you click on them](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=32e73b67f33f8410&q=earth+com+trans+neptunian+object&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J7pRxUp2pI1mXV9fBsfh39Jw_Y7pXPv6W9UjIXzt09-Y-RVsUQytO3H9U9unQ4zjSmyc1am7RU9IOaZeZLN-vxqOLRVgtOkNIBInceOOInHD1Vy8A8dMZkK6qsEDDgBo37uamqwPID1ktpoxri6hURFY-RftoYl5J3cAxl4SOYvmGkrX6Q&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT34uux4mKAxXUv4kEHYvDKEIQ0pQJegQIFBAB&biw=1137&bih=567&dpr=2.25)  
b. lead to, the following article: [Rogue star zoomed by our Solar System and disrupted planetary orbits](https://www.earth.com/news/rogue-star-zoomed-by-our-solar-system-disrupted-planetary-orbits-stretched-edges/) 

The name of the astrophysicist mentioned and a link to their profile via Google scholar is as follows: 
- [Susanne Pfalzner of Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dplYCPwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&citft=3&email_for_op=adeelnkhan%40gmail.com&sortby=pubdate)
- Susanne Pfalzner is associated with the [University of Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) I am assuming that this university works collaboratively with the Forschungszentrum Jülich institute (link is below).
- The names of two of Susanne Pfalzner's students are also mentioned. The names are: Amith Govind and Simon Portegies Zwart.

Susanne's research reminds me of: 
- The mention of some of Dr. Avi Loeb's research, along with his graduate students and team members. The little I know about research that may be associated from some of the articles that I have stumbled across. Here is a link to [Dr. Loeb's profile on Google Scholar.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CvQxOmwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&citft=3&email_for_op=adeelnkhan%40gmail.com&sortby=pubdate)
- Going back to Susanne Pfalzer's research, particularly via the Earth.com article highlighted above. Here, for me: 
- - And to provide some context. The very first time that I heard about TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) actually being called TNOs was via Professor Brian Cox. This must have been at-least 6 years ago and I cannot recall the source at this point. But I recall that it was via a video that I was watching. It's sad that the algorithms have gone all wonky on content based sites and discovery is not just broken, it feels like it has been weaponized. But that is a completely separate topic.
- -  Coming back to this topic, during the past couple of years and I cannot say that I think about this and associated areas often. But specific to the research for TNOs, I would think that only a handful of researchers are looking at this and associated areas/phenomenon around the world. And that the majority of the researchers are either from the UK (United Kingdom) and now Germany (Forschungszentrum Jülich) via [Susanne Pfalzer](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/@@search?SearchableText=Susanne%20Pfalzner&active=relevance&allow_local=false&group_select=0&local=false)
- - It was intuition that lead me to think associated thoughts. I am very interested in the make/composition of the reality around the MilkyWay and the much more expansive (and relative) cosmological (most likely quantum) realms. Specific to TNOs, here are some of the posts that I can think of. The direct source for these posts is directly via Github (unless states otherwise, as in links via Youtube and external links that I did not provision e.t.c)
